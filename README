testy
=====

This is a package of a couple of useful testing tools for Racket.  

The first is an extension command for raco that runs every file that
begins with "test-" in some directory that is specified on the command
line.

The second part is a simple module language that packages up a file in a
test-suite and provides it as the name "tests".

Both tools are probably too stupid for their own good, but they are
currently serving my testing needs well.
